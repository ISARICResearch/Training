It models each feature with missing values as a function of other features, and uses that estimate for imputation. It does so in an iterated round-robin fashion: at each step, a feature column is designated as output y and the other feature columns are treated as inputs X. A regressor is fit on (X, y) for known y. Then, the regressor is used to predict the missing values of y. This is done for each feature in an iterative fashion, and then is repeated for max_iter imputation rounds. The results of the final imputation round are returned.\n","\n","The IterativeImputer MICE method from scikit-learn is ruled by the following steps:\n","\n","**1. Initialize Missing Values**\n","\n","*   Missing values are initially replaced with a simple estimate, such as the column mean, median or most frequent value.\n","\n","**2. Define an Imputation Strategy**\n","\n","*   For each column with missing values, a regression model is defined.\n","*   This model is trained to predict the missing values using the other columns as predictors.\n","\n","**3. Iterate Over Columns**\n","\n","*   For each column with missing values, the dataset is split into training data (non-missing values) and test data (missing values).\n","*   A regression model is trained on the available values and then used to predict the missing values.\n","*   The imputed values are updated and used in the next iteration for further refinement.\n","\n","**4. Repeat Until Convergence**\n","\n","*   This process is repeated for n_iter iterations (default = 10).\n","*   At each iteration, the imputed values are refined as the models adapt better to the data.\n","*   The final imputed values are those obtained after the last iteration.\n","\n","Unlike traditional MICE implementations, that generate multiple imputed datasets, IterativeImputer in scikit-learn keeps only a single dataset with the final imputed values."],"metadata":{"id":"LEz5Jo1eSw7E"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Arguments"],"metadata":{"id":"VhIiEnqsWqqP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**df**: *object, mandatory*\n","\n","The original dataset which can contain missing values or not and both numerial and categorical variables.\n","\n","**interest_vars:** *list, default = None*\n","\n","List formed by the name of the columns of the only numerical and categorical variables that will be used by the algorith to make the predictions and worn in the statistical analysis table.
