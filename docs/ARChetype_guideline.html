            <p> ARChetype Case Report Forms (CRF) are a key component of the <a href="https://isaric.org/resources/clinical-characterisation-protocol/ target="_blank"> ISARIC-WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) </a> framework, strengthening global preparedness and response to infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p> The ISARIC-WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) framework is a global, inclusive initiative offering a comprehensive approach for the rapid and standardised 
                characterisation of (re)emerging infectious diseases. Within this framework, ISARIC supports researchers by providing a suite of standardised tools, including protocols, 
                ARChetype case report forms (CRFs), and a CRF generator (<a href="https://isaric-bridge.replit.app/ target="_blank">  BRIDGE </a>) that allows forms to be tailored to local 
                needs while ensuring consistent data collection. These tools utilise uniform questions, choices, and terminology, ensuring machine-readable, high-quality data across studies.
                Moreover,<a href="https://isaric.org/resources/data// target="_blank"> ISARIC Clinical Epidemiology Platform </a> offers resources for efficient data capture and management and
                has developed an automated pipeline that can generate dashboards and results, aiding in the analysis of data and dissemination of evidence. </p>
                <p>Central coordination by ISARIC promotes streamlined communication and collaboration among researchers, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of research efforts.
                Researchers also benefit from the experience and expertise of a global network of ISARIC collaborators. This network facilitates coordinated research efforts and enhances
                the collective response to infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

            <h2>CRF Creation Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                The ISARIC’s methodology for developing archetype CCP CRFs, emphasises essential stages from initial identification of the need, through to final release and establishment of 
                ongoing feedback mechanisms. </p>
               <p> <i> Please note that the guidelines will be adapted to reflect the context of the epidemic and disease.</i> </p>

                    <h3>1. Identify the Need</h3>
                    <p>Any ISARIC staff or research partner may propose the development of a new CRF. The justification, specific requirements, and objectives of the CRF can be proposed to the ISARIC CCP team at <a href="mailto:data@isaric.org">data@isaric.org</a>. </p>

                    <p>Where the topic is outside of the scope of ISARIC’s activities, the CCP Coordinator will liaise with the ISARIC Executive Board (EB) to obtain a decision on endorsement and progression of CRF development. The EB will consider (a) the public health impact of the disease/syndrome, (b) existing research efforts to address the objectives proposed, (c) engagement of appropriate stakeholders (d) ISARIC’s ability to add unique value to global evidence generation efforts through development of the CRF. 
                    <p><i>Note:  activities 3-7 below may be initiated in parallel to the endorsement process to speed up the process in the event of an active outbreak. </i></p>

                        researchers who have published relevant literature on the disease, clinicians with patient management experience, data managers, related global health actors, and regulatory bodies who will be invited to provide input and ensure alignment with diverse requirements. The Owner will identify a subset of Experts whose input would most benefit an early stage of CRF iteration and designate them as ‘Expert Reviewers’.  </p>

                        related initiatives and what parties should be involved in its development. WHO feedback will be incorporated as much as possible by iteration of the required steps above or below.</p>

                        to address these questions from the ISARIC Analysis and Research Compendium (ARC). Variables that do not have existing structures in ARC will be drafted by the CRF Owner and relevant experts and submitted for inclusion in ARC via the ARC process. </p>
